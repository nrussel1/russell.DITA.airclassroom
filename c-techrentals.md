# Additional Services: Technology Rentals

AirClassroom is committed to providing its customers with the best service possible and meeting their every need when it comes to renting classrooms on the campus of Virginia Tech. With those values in mind, we have recently expanded our services outside of our original classroom rentals within Shanks Hall to also include the opportunity for technology rentals. This service has been implemented for our users to make the most out of the experience renting classrooms through our company by providing additional resources to aid in their academic, professional, and personal success.


## Items Available for Rent:

- MacBook Laptop
- iPad Pro
- Canon Vixia HF G40 Camcorder

### MacBook Laptop

In addition to the Macintosh desktop computers found in both Shanks 180 & 360, AirClassroom offers the ability to rent MacBook Laptops for the duration of your classroom rental. Our research has concluded that by using a laptop, group work is easier to accomplish due to increased collaboration and versatility in movement around the room. Laptops also give users the freedom to work away from the designated desks and towards more alternative work spaces such as their laps or even spread out on the ground. MacBooks come fully loaded with all Apple software and the most standard of programs including, but not limited to, Microsoft Office, Safari, Pages, Keynote, iMovie, GarageBand, and Facetime. They are equipped for virtually any project or need our users might have during their time in their rented classroom.

### iPad Pro

Looking for even more technological flexibility? AirClassroom is also providing iPad Pro’s to rent as well. This multifaceted gadget gives users greater adaptability for creative work and tasks that don’t require a keyboard. iPad Pro’s give users the opportunity to quickly search, scribble, or surf while working towards any task in front of them.

### Canon Vixia HF G40 Camcorder

Whether for a school project or professional endeavor, AirClassroom understands the need for multimedia technology and recording opportunities within their classrooms.
